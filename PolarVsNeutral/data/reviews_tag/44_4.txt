A/DT rather/RB lame/NN teen/JJ slasher/NN from/IN Brisbane/NNP ./. While/IN the/DT plot/NN hinges/VBZ on/IN a/DT fairly/RB decent/JJ idea/NN ,/, the/DT writing/NN is/VBZ profoundly/RB lame/JJ and/CC two/CD of/IN the/DT three/CD main/JJ teens/NNS are/VBP absurdly/RB wooden/JJ ./. The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN for/IN the/DT kids/NNS to/TO go/VB through/IN with/IN their/PRP$ plan/NN they/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB far/RB more/JJR reckless/JJ than/IN shown/VBN ,/, but/CC if/IN they/PRP were/VBD that/IN devil-may-care/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD perhaps/RB be/VB hard/JJ for/IN them/PRP to/TO be/VB likable/JJ ,/, so/IN they/PRP end/VBP up/RP being/VBG neither/DT really/RB ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, I/PRP only/RB started/VBD enjoying/VBG the/DT film/NN when/WRB I/PRP started/VBD wishing/VBG for/IN their/PRP$ death/NN ./. One/CD of/IN those/DT movies/NNS where/WRB in/IN about/IN a/DT thousand/NN places/VBZ the/DT most/RBS sensible/JJ option/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO call/VB the/DT police/NN ./. I/PRP realise/VBP we/PRP would/MD n't/RB have/VB a/DT movie/NN if/IN they/PRP did/VBD ,/, but/CC it/PRP would/MD be/VB nice/JJ if/IN we/PRP could/MD believe/VB that/IN they/PRP actually/RB would/MD n't/RB ./.
