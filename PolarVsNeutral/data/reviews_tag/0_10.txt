I/PRP went/VBD and/CC saw/VBD this/DT movie/NN last/JJ night/NN after/IN being/VBG coaxed/VBN to/TO by/IN a/DT few/JJ friends/NNS of/IN mine/NN ./. I/PRP 'll/MD admit/VB that/IN I/PRP was/VBD reluctant/JJ to/TO see/VB it/PRP because/IN from/IN what/WP I/PRP knew/VBD of/IN Ashton/NNP Kutcher/NNP he/PRP was/VBD only/RB able/JJ to/TO do/VB comedy/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD wrong/JJ ./. Kutcher/NNP played/VBD the/DT character/NN of/IN Jake/NNP Fischer/NNP very/RB well/RB ,/, and/CC Kevin/NNP Costner/NNP played/VBD Ben/NNP Randall/NNP with/IN such/JJ professionalism/NN ./. The/DT sign/NN of/IN a/DT good/JJ movie/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP can/MD toy/VB with/IN our/PRP$ emotions/NNS ./. This/DT one/CD did/VBD exactly/RB that/IN ./. The/DT entire/JJ theater/NN (/( which/WDT was/VBD sold/VBN out/RP )/) was/VBD overcome/VBN by/IN laughter/NN during/IN the/DT first/JJ half/NN of/IN the/DT movie/NN ,/, and/CC were/VBD moved/VBN to/TO tears/NNS during/IN the/DT second/JJ half/NN ./. While/IN exiting/VBG the/DT theater/NN I/PRP not/RB only/RB saw/VBD many/JJ women/NNS in/IN tears/NNS ,/, but/CC many/JJ full/JJ grown/VBN men/NNS as/IN well/RB ,/, trying/VBG desperately/RB not/RB to/TO let/VB anyone/NN see/VB them/PRP crying/VBG ./. This/DT movie/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP suggest/VBP that/IN you/PRP go/VBP see/VB it/PRP before/IN you/PRP judge/VBP ./.
