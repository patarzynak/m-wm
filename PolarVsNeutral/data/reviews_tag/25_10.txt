This/DT is/VBZ a/DT movie/NN that/WDT deserves/VBZ another/DT look/NN --/: if/IN you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB seen/VBN it/PRP for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, or/CC a/DT first/JJ look/NN --/: if/IN you/PRP were/VBD too/RB young/JJ when/WRB it/PRP came/VBD out/RP (/( 1983/CD )/) ./. Based/VBN on/IN a/DT play/NN by/IN the/DT same/JJ name/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT story/NN of/IN an/DT older/JJR actor/NN who/WP heads/VBZ a/DT touring/JJ Shakespearean/JJ repertory/NN company/NN in/IN England/NNP during/IN World/NNP War/NNP II/NNP ./.
